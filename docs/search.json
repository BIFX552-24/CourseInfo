    "text": "Syllabus\n\nCourse Description\nThis class provides an introduction to applied data science skills needed by bioinformatics professionals. A focus will be placed on reproducible bioinformatics research and will include the following topics and tools: beginning to intermediate use of the Unix command line, working with remote computing resources, version tracking, R and Bioconductor, tools for manipulating sequence data, and creation of pipelines.\n\nInstructor: Randall Johnson, PhD\nOffice hours: Office hours will be held immediately before and after in-person meetings. Email me to schedule a virtual office hour at another time.\nPrerequisites: BIFX 503\nTextbooks: We will not be using a textbook this term, but you may find the following helpful. All are freely available online.\n\nR for Data Science\nAdvanced R\nR Packages\n\nCommunications: Course communications will be posted on Blackboard.\nCode of Conduct: We want to foster a safe, enjoyable and productive learning environment. People like you add value to our program. To meet this end, all participants will be expected to follow the course code of conduct located in the course documents on Blackboard.\nGradCare: Graduate school can be stressful. Hood College is here to help. We offer a wide range of support services for graduate students. Our programs and resources address the eight dimensions of wellness—emotional, physical, social, intellectual, spiritual, occupational, financial and environmental—so you can stay healthy while maintaining school-work-life balance.\nAccessibility: As the instructor of this course, I endeavor to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course, do not hesitate to discuss them with me and the Office for Accessibility Services, 301-696-3421, gmuer@hood.edu.\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nOn completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the following:\n\nUse of R and Bioconductor to perform bioinformatic analysis tasks\nUse of the Unix command line to manipulate data and perform bioinformatic analysis tasks\nLogging into and using remote computing resources\nWorking with version controlled code repositories in a collaborative work environment\nStitching a series of commands and/or programs together into a reusable pipeline\n\n\n\nAsynchronous and In-Person Content\nAsynchronous content will be posted weekly, and in-person labs will be scheduled on Tuesday evenings throughout the term at 5:30 PM (see the schedule below). If you need to attend a particular class virtually (e.g. while on travel), in-person labs can be streamed. Much of the course content will be based on up-to-date, publicly available material from experts in the Data Carpentry, Software Carpentry, and Bioconductor communities.\n\n\nHomework and Course Project\nThere will be homework assignments associated with each course module. This will give you an opportunity to practice what we cover each week. Homework from asynchronous content will typically be due on Tuesdays and should be completed before each in-person meeting. The last few weeks of the course will be devoted to a group project based on a bioinformatics workflow from Bioconductor.\n\n\nGrading\nGrades will be based on completion of homework, a group project and two exams.\n\nAsynchronous Content - 25%\nIn-person Content - 25%\nBioconductor Project - 10%\nMid-term - 20%\nFinal exam - 20%\n\nLate submissions of any work will be subject to a 5% penalty for each day past the due date. The maximum penalty for late work will be 50%.\n\n\nWeather\nIn the event of severe weather resulting in the closure of Hood College and the cancellation of an in-person meeting, the meeting will be held virtually at the scheduled time and a recording posted on Blackboard for asynchronous viewing.\n\n\nTentative Class Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nAsynchronous Content\nIn Person Content\n\n\n\n\n1\nAug 20\nGit\nClass intro, Markdown / Quarto\n\n\n2\nAug 27\nR Intro\nBioinformatics Tools Survey\n\n\n3\nSep 3\nSubsetting Data, R Control Flow\np-Hacking\n\n\n4\nSep 10\nR Graphics, R Vectorization, R Functions\nRNA-Seq Data Viz\n\n\n5\nSep 17\nR Advanced Data\nCanine Confounders\n\n\n6\nSep 24\nJoining Tables, R Software Tips\nAntibiotics Under Our Feet\n\n\n7\nOct 1\nCatch Up\nPopulation Genetics Simulation\n\n\n8\nOct 8\nMidterm\nMidterm Q/A (virtual)\n\n\n9\nOct 15\nFall break\n(no class)\n\n\n10\nOct 22\nUnix\nCommand Line Practice\n\n\n11\nOct 29\nSnakemake\nDocker practice\n\n\n12\nNov 5\nVariant Calling Workflow\nVariant Calling Pipeline\n\n\n13\nNov 12\nAdvanced Snakemake\nVariant Calling Pipeline (cont)\n\n\n14\nNov 19\nIntro to Bioconductor\nBioconductor Project\n\n\n15\nNov 26\nGroup Work\nProject Q/A (in person)\n\n\n16\nDec 3\nGroup Work\nProject Presentations / Final Exam",

    "text": "Academic Honor Code\nStudents are obligated to uphold principles of honesty, responsibility, and intellectual integrity in all activities related to their Hood College experience. The Academic Honor Code — a subset of the Code of Conduct — outlines expectations for student academic behavior and prohibits cheating and unauthorized assistance, plagiarism, resubmission of duplicate work, and other forms of academic dishonesty. Students should review the full Academic Honor Code located in Appendix B of the Student Handbook. Students should always consult with instructors to determine what types of aid are permitted in each specific class and on each assignment.\nFaculty have authority to investigate alleged violations and issue sanctions. For unintentional plagiarism or similar violations, a sanction of a zero on the assignment is usually appropriate. For intentional plagiarism, cheating, and similar violations, failure of the course is a reasonable sanction. Faculty are required to report all violations to the Chair of the Academic Judicial Council (AJC), the Dean of Student Success. AJC will conduct hearings for students with egregious and/or multiple violations to determine if additional sanctions beyond those imposed by the instructor are warranted, including Suspension from the College.",

There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. AI should be used to facilitate, rather than hinder, learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments.

As with last week’s lesson, you have a few options on how to proceed. You only need to pick one option - I would recommend either the Docker or Hood cluster options.\n\nDocker\nYou may use Docker if you would like. The command for starting up Docker is\ndocker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source=\"$(pwd)\",target=/root/loc johnsonra/snakemake\nIf that doesn’t work (Windows computers may not like the $(pwd) part of the command), specify the entire path to the location of your repository on your laptop:\ndocker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source=\"C:\\Path\\to\\your\\repository\",target=/root/loc johnsonra/snakemake\nThe videos recommend using the --rm tag. I’ll be revising that convention in the videos for Advanced Snakemake to reuse an existing container as we did in class this week. You may do that for this lesson as well if you are comfortable with deviating from the videos a little. Otherwise you can stick with the videos.\n\n\n\nHood cluster\nIf you choose to work on the Hood cluster (see login instructions), you may need to run the following commands to set up your environment.\n\nRun this command one time, log out and then connect again:\n\n/BIODATA/programs/mambaforge/bin/conda init bash\n\nRun this command every time you log in when you want to use Snakemake:\n\n/BIODATA/programs/mambaforge/bin/conda activate snakemake_carpentry\n\n\nLocal installation\nIf you would like to work locally, you may follow these setup instructions provided by the Software Carpentry authors.",

Rather than copy the 1+ GB directory with the data for this lesson a bunch of times (once for each person), we’ll create a symbolic link to the data and copy over the bits that we will be modifying ourselves. Navigate to your home directory and do the following:\n```{bash}\n# go home\ncd ~\n\n# create a new `Ecoli` directory\nmkdir Ecoli\ncd Ecoli\n\n# create directories that we will be working with\nmkdir results\nmkdir scripts\nmkdir trimmed_fastq\n\n# link new data directories to your directory\nln -s /BIODATA/BIFX552/Ecoli/Ecoli_metadata_composite.csv .\nln -s /BIODATA/BIFX552/Ecoli/data .\nln -s /BIODATA/BIFX552/Ecoli/untrimmed_fastq .\n```\nShould the cluster become unavailable or if you want to work locally (e.g. on your laptop), you can use the Docker container we set up in class or follow the instructions here to get your environment set up.",
