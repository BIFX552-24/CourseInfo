    "text": "Syllabus\n\nCourse Description\nThis class provides an introduction to applied data science skills needed by bioinformatics professionals. A focus will be placed on reproducible bioinformatics research and will include the following topics and tools: beginning to intermediate use of the Unix command line, working with remote computing resources, version tracking, R and Bioconductor, tools for manipulating sequence data, and creation of pipelines.\n\nInstructor: Randall Johnson, PhD\nOffice hours: Office hours will be held immediately before and after in-person meetings. Email me to schedule a virtual office hour at another time.\nPrerequisites: BIFX 503\nTextbooks: We will not be using a textbook this term, but you may find the following helpful. All are freely available online.\n\nR for Data Science\nAdvanced R\nR Packages\n\nCommunications: Course communications will be posted on Blackboard.\nCode of Conduct: We want to foster a safe, enjoyable and productive learning environment. People like you add value to our program. To meet this end, all participants will be expected to follow the course code of conduct located in the course documents on Blackboard.\nGradCare: Graduate school can be stressful. Hood College is here to help. We offer a wide range of support services for graduate students. Our programs and resources address the eight dimensions of wellness—emotional, physical, social, intellectual, spiritual, occupational, financial and environmental—so you can stay healthy while maintaining school-work-life balance.\nAccessibility: As the instructor of this course, I endeavor to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course, do not hesitate to discuss them with me and the Office for Accessibility Services, 301-696-3421, gmuer@hood.edu.\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nOn completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the following:\n\nUse of R and Bioconductor to perform bioinformatic analysis tasks\nUse of the Unix command line to manipulate data and perform bioinformatic analysis tasks\nLogging into and using remote computing resources\nWorking with version controlled code repositories in a collaborative work environment\nStitching a series of commands and/or programs together into a reusable pipeline\n\n\n\nAsynchronous and In-Person Content\nAsynchronous content will be posted weekly, and in-person labs will be scheduled on Tuesday evenings throughout the term at 5:30 PM (see the schedule below). If you need to attend a particular class virtually (e.g. while on travel), in-person labs can be streamed. Course content will be based on up-to-date, publicly available material from experts in the Data Carpentry, Software Carpentry, and Bioconductor communities.\n\n\nHomework and Course Project\nThere will be homework assignments associated with each course module. This will give you an opportunity to practice what we cover each week. Homework from asynchronous content will be due on Tuesdays and should be completed before each in-person meeting. The last few weeks of the course will be devoted to a group project based on a bioinformatics workflow from Bioconductor.\n\n\nGrading\nGrades will be based on completion of homework, a group project and two exams.\n\nAsynchronous Content - 25%\nIn-person Content - 25%\nBioconductor Project - 10%\nMid-term - 20%\nFinal exam - 20%\n\nLate submissions of any work will be subject to a 5% penalty for each day past the due date. The maximum penalty for late work will be 50%.\n\n\nWeather\nIn the event of severe weather resulting in the closure of Hood College and the cancellation of an in-person meeting, the meeting will be held virtually at the scheduled time and a recording posted on Blackboard for asynchronous viewing.\n\n\nTentative Class Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nAsynchronous Content\nIn Person Content\n\n\n\n\n1\nAug 20\nGit\nClass intro, Markdown / Quarto\n\n\n2\nAug 27\nR Intro\ngit practice\n\n\n3\nSep 3\nSubsetting Data, R Control Flow\nP-Hacking\n\n\n4\nSep 10\nR Graphics, R Vectorization, R Functions\nRNA-Seq Data Viz\n\n\n5\nSep 17\nR Advanced Data\nCanine Confounders\n\n\n6\nSep 24\nJoining Tables, R Software Tips\nAntibiotics Under Our Feet\n\n\n7\nOct 1\nCatch Up\nReview/Synthesis\n\n\n8\nOct 8\nMidterm\nMidterm Q/A (virtual)\n\n\n9\nOct 15\nFall break\n(no class)\n\n\n10\nOct 22\nUnix\nCommand Line Practice\n\n\n11\nOct 29\nSnakemake\nDocker practice\n\n\n12\nNov 5\nVariant Calling Workflow\nVariant Calling Pipeline\n\n\n13\nNov 12\nAdvanced Snakemake\nVariant Calling Pipeline (cont)\n\n\n14\nNov 19\nIntro to Bioconductor\nBioconductor Project\n\n\n15\nNov 26\nGroup Work\nProject Q/A (in person)\n\n\n16\nDec 3\nGroup Work\nProject Presentations / Final Exam",
